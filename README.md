# SenseBorg
A modular platform for human sensory adaptation via haptic feedback.  

## Introduction
Sensory adaptation (in humans) is the process of the sensory system changing its relative sensitivity to sensory stimuli. An easy example of this is getting used to a cold pool after spending time in it. Sensory adaptation can occur on higher levels, such as after-effects in the vision system, from colors to facial attributes. Sensory adaptation can also result in the learning of new sensorimotor contingencies, or in simpler words "learning a new sense". Finally sensory adaptation can even occur in response to artificial stimuli. These are the scientific principles one which this project operates. For a more detailed writeup on this project, please check out the wiki.  


## The Project
Artificial sensory adaptation requires two parts.  
1. Some way to provide artificial stimuli  
2. Some way to generate this stimuli (usually a sensor of some kind)  

Good examples of this are the BrainPort and feelSpace belt devices. My project nicknamed "SenseBorg" (think Senses + Cyborg) is my contribution to this under-explored area of research.  

These two parts of my project are:
1. A custom belt, with up to 16 embedded haptic motors, for generating artificial stimuli with selectable position and strength.  
2. An IMU headband for sensing rotational acceleration, as an approximation of the sense of balance.  

The second part of the project can be easily substituted for any other sensor, which could be used to conduct experiments into learning other sensorimotor contingencies.  
Thus, this project provides a platform for providing artificial stimuli for use in more general artificial sensory adaptation experiments.


## This Repository
This repository contains the software and hardware information for the SenseBorg belt itself. Of course, a lot of the software is specific to interfacing with my specific sensor system, and translating this into targeted haptic feedback. Please have a look at build/BUILD.md for a build guide. This project is currently in it's first iteration, so is subject to change and improvement.


## Results
After a first experiment, the hypothesis that the wearing of this belt would result in an increase in the wearer's sense of balance, was shown to be statistically significant. (Balance was tested via a sharpened Romberg Test, the belt was worn over a week period for 12 hours a day, the statistical difference was measured via a T-test, and the final p < 0.01)
A full writeup of this experiment will be made available soon for specific information on methodology and data analysis.
Hopefully, a second iteration of this experiment will be conducted over the summer!
