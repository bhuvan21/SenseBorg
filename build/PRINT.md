# Print Guide

There are a few different parts which need to be 3D printed for this build.  

The box is made of box.stl and top.stl.
Both can be printed with ~15% infill or higher, these parts don't need to be super strong.  
Print orientation is pretty straightforward, print the box with the flat bottom side downwards, and the top with the eye facing upwards.  

The motor clips should be able to be printed as is, with the side for each clip facing downwards. There are slight small overhangs, but hopefully no supports should be needed for you. Try printing one, and if it fails, use supports. The clips print in place, so the axle should stay in the hole without sticking.  
The IMU clip is a normal clips, and should definitely not need supports.  

PLA works well for any of these prints, though if you can get your hands on ABS or PETG, that would probably be better.  
All of these prints shouldn't take too long, the clips are pretty small.
